        I confess: I am the worst junk food junkie in this great gluttonous galaxy of sugar, salt, and fat. You can keep your
        lentils, granola, and prunes. I want calories and carbohydrates, burgers and fries. Within minutes after waking up
        grouchy and puffy-eyed in the morning, I stumble to the kitchen and pour myself a tall glass of ice-cold Pepsi. Ahh! My
        tongue tingles and my eyes pop open. I then have the energy to eat. I rummage through the refrigerator, push aside the
        yogurt and apples, and there it is: a slice of congealed pepperoni pizza. That's enough to get me off to school and
        through my first class. Of course, I then head to the store on my first break for a Snickers bar and a Diet Mountain
        Dew. The "lite" soft drink, you see, compensates for the calories in the candy. An hour or two later, for lunch, I
        gobble down a row of Golden Double Stuf Oreos and a peanut butter sandwich, all sloshed down with a pint of chocolate
        milk. Later in the afternoon, I stop at Five Guys to devour a double bacon cheeseburger and a monster order of
        sodium-loaded fries. Finally, before going to bed, I knock off a bag of Philly Cheese Steak Rippled Potato
        Chipsâ€”dripping with onion dip.
